description: 'We are now almost ready to reveal a Leadership Development Initiative like none other. We have discussed about Leadership and the complications related to Leadership Development. We have also explored Theatre as a medium to deliver “Natural Learning” methodology for Leadership Development. We are excited to share that we have developed a Leadership Development Initiative by combining the expertise of three diverse groups. First, we have a renowned Theatre group with almost 35 years of experience which has trained more than 1,500 people till date. We also have an organisation design expert with more than 22 years’ experience across various industries and consulting. Then we have someone with almost 25 years of corporate experience dealing with theory and practice of leadership. These groups have spent the last four months exploring how Theatre based “Natural Learning” can be successfully applied to Leadership Development. We have looked at the available literature, our personal experiences, and discussed the experience of numerous leaders to create a unique program. A program that is designed to take the performance of leaders in the organisation to the next level. We are very excited with what will be revealed tomorrow morning and we are sure you will be too.'
